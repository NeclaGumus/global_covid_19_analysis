COVID-19 Global Data Analysis (Python + Tableau)

Objective:

This project aims to explore and analyze the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic across the world using real data from Our World in Data. The analysis focuses on trends in daily cases, deaths, and vaccination efforts, with a deep dive into selected countries, particularly the United Kingdom.

Tools Used:

Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization

Tableau for building interactive dashboards and maps

Dataset Source: Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset

Key Questions Explored:

How did COVID-19 spread over time across the world?

Which countries had the highest and lowest case and death rates?

What impact did vaccination efforts have on daily case trends?

What Youâ€™ll See in This Notebook:

Data cleaning and exploration using Python

Visualizations for daily new cases, deaths, and vaccinations

Insights drawn from temporal and geographic trends

Export-ready dataset for Tableau dashboard design (shared separately)

Outcome:

This project serves as a part of my data analyst portfolio, demonstrating my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize real-world data to derive meaningful insights.
